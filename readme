A diagnostic model for multi classification recognition of NC, MCI and AD using ADNI data of public database and deep Transfer learning method. 
First, use the Transfer learning method to initialize the VGG network parameters,
and use MRI brain images and PET brain images to train the network model to fine tune the network parameters,
forming two independent single-mode CNN networks (MRI-CNN, PET-CNN),
then extract the feature vectors of MRI-CNN and PET-CNN networks respectively and fuse them, 
and finally build a full connection layer for MRI-CNN and PET-CNN networks,

And use the Adaboost algorithm to select and fuse features, and construct a classifier for classification and recognition. 

On the basis of widely available, low-cost, and non-invasive cognitive assessment, 
the fusion of MRI and PET imaging provides technical support for ultra early personalized monitoring of AD and the development of scientific and reasonable personalized brain health management plans.
